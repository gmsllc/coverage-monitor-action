A GitHub Action that monitor coverage.
Forked of <https://github.com/slavcodev/coverage-monitor-action|slavcodev/coverage-monitor-action>

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow .yml file in your repositories .github/workflows directory.
The action works with `pull_request` event (check coverage and comment) and with `push` event (store coverage report in S3 for diff).

### Inputs

- `github-token` - The GITHUB_TOKEN secret.
- `clover-file` - Path to Clover XML file.
- `check` - Whether check the coverage thresholds.
- `comment` - Whether comment the coverage report.
- `threshold-alert` - Mark the build as unstable when coverage is less than this threshold.
- `threshold-warning` - Warning when coverage is less than this threshold.
- `status-context` - A string label to differentiate this status from the status of other systems.
- `comment-context` - A string label to differentiate the comment posted by this action.
- `comment-mode` - A mode for comments, supported: `replace`, `update` or `insert`.
- `base-clover-file` - Path to base Clover XML file. If specified then action won't try to download file from S3.
- `diff-tolerance` - Tolerance for coverage drop.
- `ignore-missing-base` - Do not throw an error if base coverage file is missing.
- `s3-bucket` - AWS S3 Bucket name.
- `s3-access-key-id` - AWS S3 Access Key Id.
- `s3-secret-access-key` - AWS S3 Secret Access Key.
- `s3-key-prefix` - S3 key prefix for coverage report storage inside bucket. Default: `coverage/${repository.full_name}`.
